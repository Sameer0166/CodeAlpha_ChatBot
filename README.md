# CodeAlpha_ChatBot
ChatBot
## Project Description  
CodeAlpha_ChatBot is a **console-based interactive chatbot** built with Python. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and modular code design. It interacts with users by greeting them, telling jokes, providing the current time, and simulating weather updates, making learning Python fun and practical. Perfect for beginners and great to showcase in internship portfolios.

## Features  
- Random greetings for inputs like "hello", "hi", "hey".  
- Provides current system date and time in a readable format.  
- Shares programmer-themed jokes randomly.  
- Simulated weather updates for conversational fun.  
- Handles casual queries like "how are you".  
- Helpful fallback messages every third unrecognized input.  
- Graceful exit commands: "bye", "exit", or "quit".  
- Clean modular functions structure for easy extension.

## Installation Instructions  
- Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed.  
- Save the chatbot code in a file named `basic_chatbot.py`.  
- Open a terminal or command prompt.  
- Navigate to the folder containing the file.  
- Run the chatbot with:  

## How to Use  
- The chatbot will guide you with available commands such as "hello", "time", "tell me a joke", "weather", or "bye".  
- Type these or other supported phrases to interact.  
- Type "bye", "exit", or "quit" to end the chat session.

## Code Structure and Explanation  
- **greet_user()**: Selects a random greeting.  
- **get_current_time()**: Returns formatted current date and time.  
- **tell_joke()**: Random programmer jokes from a list.  
- **get_weather()**: Static friendly weather message.  
- **chatbot_response(user_input, turn_count)**: Matches input keywords to responses and handles fallback messages.  
- **run_chatbot()**: Main interaction loop manages conversation turns and exits cleanly.

## Example Interaction  
You: hello

Chatbot: Hey!

You: tell me a joke

Chatbot: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

You: what time is it

Chatbot: It's 08:59 PM on Monday, September 08, 2025.

You: weather

Chatbot: The weather today is sunny with a light breeze. Perfect day to code!

You: bye

Chatbot: Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.

## Future Improvements  
- Add integration with a real weather API for live weather info.  
- Include more conversational topics and replies.  
- Implement persistent chat logging to save conversations.  
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Explore basic NLP for smarter responses.
